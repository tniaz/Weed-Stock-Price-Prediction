# Project Description

This project allows the user to use historical weed stock price data along with sentiment analysis to predict future prices. Historical prices are pulled from Yahoo, news text is fed using several Canadian sources with NewsAPI, and sentiment analysis is done using TextBlob.


# Getting Started

1. Use Yahoo Data Pull.ipynb to pull historical price data and save it to weedstockdata.csv
2. Run NewsAPI and TextBlob for News Scores.ipynb to pull all marijuana related articles from various Canadian news sources. Also, TextBlob performs sentiment analysis and all the relevant data is saved to newsscores.csv
3. Finally run Plotting from csv files.ipynb to plot the data from the .csv files and draw conclusions


# Troubleshooting

If the .ipynb files do not load on GitHub, please copy each .ipynb GitHub URL directly into:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

* This is a GitHub issue with Jupyter Notebook compatibility
